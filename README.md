## 🎬 About The Project

Let's be real—most anime sites feel like they're stuck in the past. AniHeaven is our answer to that. We wanted a platform that feels modern, fast, and actually enjoyable to use. No clutter, no lag, just the content you want with a UI that passes the vibe check.

Built with the latest tech stack, it’s designed for speed and simplicity. Best of all? It's completely open-source.

- **Resume Watching:** We remember exactly where you left off.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Full control without touching the mouse.

### 🎨 UI & UX
